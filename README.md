Setup and Deployment Guide

1. Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed on your system:
Node.js (version X.X.X or higher)
Git
NPM (comes with Node.js)
Any additional tools or frameworks (e.g., Next.js, Strapi)


2. Clone the Repository
Run the following command to clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/mxbraun4/website_project_jee.git
Navigate into the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd website_project_jee


3. Install Dependencies
Install the required packages using:
bash
Copy code
npm install


(4. Configuration
Set up environment variables:
Create a .env.local file in the root directory.
Add the required environment variables (replace placeholders with actual values):
makefile
Copy code
API_URL=<your-api-url>
DATABASE_URL=<your-database-url>)


5. Local Development
Run the project locally:
bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Access the application at http://localhost:3000.


6. Deployment
To Deploy to [Your Hosting Provider]:
Build the Project:
bash
Copy code
npm run build
Start the Server (for production):
bash
Copy code
npm start
Host-Specific Steps:
For Vercel: Push changes to the main branch; deployment is automatic.
For Netlify: Configure build settings in the Netlify dashboard.
Optional - Using Docker:
Build the Docker image:
bash
Copy code
docker build -t my-website .
Run the container:
bash
Copy code
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-website


7. Troubleshooting
Dependencies Not Installing: Ensure Node.js and NPM are installed and updated.
Environment Variables Missing: Double-check .env.local values.
Server Crashing: Check logs for specific errors:
bash
Copy code
npm run dev


8. Additional Notes
Add documentation for any frameworks (e.g., Next.js, Tailwind).
Mention CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions) if used.
